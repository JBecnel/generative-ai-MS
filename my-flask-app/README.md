# My Flask App

This is a simple web application built using Flask. It serves as a starting point for developing web applications with Python.

## Project Structure

```
my-flask-app
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py       # Initializes the Flask application
│   ├── routes.py         # Defines the application routes
│   └── templates
│       └── index.html    # HTML template for the home page
├── requirements.txt       # Lists project dependencies
├── run.py                 # Entry point to run the application
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-flask-app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the Flask application, execute the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```

The application will start and can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, navigate to the home page to see the content rendered from `index.html`. You can modify the routes and templates to expand the functionality of the application.
